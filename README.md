# Calculator
This repository aims to collaborate with developers who plan to migrate to mobile development on the Android platform. 
This application shows an example of a calculator App. 
The App contains the rules of the four mathematical operations and the main characteristics that an Android App should have. 
Feel free to do some improvements in the code.
